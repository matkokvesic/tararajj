## Warmup

1. Short warmup, warmup specifically for legs

## Drills

1. Partner executes takedown and tries to establish position → other partner, after he falls, tries to prevent points being scored on him and gets up immediately → partner executing takedown never backs off, maintains contact and executes another takedown again → alternate, each partner executes 10 takedowns, partner that is defending the takedown goes 50% in defending the takedown, but 100% getting back up

2. Start from standing up, control on collar and sleeve, put opponent inside closed guard →  establish control of both sleeves and, move your hips out and establish the spider guard → go for spider guard sweep → opponent defends by posting on leg → draw opponents leg with leg, grab with arm underneath the leg and establish control of opponents leg, end up in modified x-like guard position → pull opponents arm, push with legs and work to x-guard position, sweep straight to side control
